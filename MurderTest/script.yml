              The body of Zeke Calhoun is slumped in the corner of the stables, out of sight of the
              door. He is battered about the face and body, with a nasty bruise to the left temple.
              His wrists are chafed, reddened, and in an awkward position behind his back as
              though they have been tied together. On the ground nearby are short lengths of rope,
              cut with a sharp knife. A toppled chair is nearby.
              The top pocket of Zeke's plaid shirt has been cut open and is flapping empty. Apart
              from that, his pockets contain the usual sorts of things and do not seem to have been
              searched.
              There are no signs of shooting, stabbing or strangling. It does not look like the blow on
              the head was enough to kill him.

              You may arrest someone under suspicion
              and throw them in jail. The Bartender will
              restrict their movement and prevent them
              from using their abilities. However, if you
              cannot present suitable evidence to the
              Bartender within 15 minutes (or 5 minutes if
              the judgment hasn't yet been delivered),
              they will be released.

              When you shoot someone, you hit them if
              you win or tie at rock-paper-scissors, rather
              than just when you win as is normal.
