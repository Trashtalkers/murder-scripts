            One year ago, Robert Killingsworth bought the farm.  Six months later, he was dead - leaving his widow
            Elizabeth to tend to their fledgling vineyard and winery on the outskirts of California's wine country.  With mounting debts and no idea how to run a business, Elizabeth is desperate to sell the farm and recoup her losses. The fierce drought and shaky economy, however, have left Killingsworth Farm on the market for far too long. 
            One early autumn day, six people passed through the gates of Killingsworth Farm to see Elizabeth...  <br />
            One of them, a cold-blooded Killer.

            The sun is setting beyond the rolling hills of California's lush wine country, and you find yourself standing in the
            front hall of the main house on Killingsworth Farms.
            You arrived earlier today to see Elizabeth Killingsworth, a recent widow who, due to hard times, is looking to sell
            the farm that she and her husband purchased just over a year ago.
            Five others have joined you in the hall. Elizabeth, however, is not present. The strangers around you are looking
            at you with interest. You help yourself to a glass of wine from the hall table and introduce yourself.

      Dr. Chelsea Barren:
        tasks:
          - Introduce yourself.
        information:        
          - >
            Although you do not consider yourself a friend to Elizabeth (just nodding terms as you pass), you live next door
            to the Killingsworth Farm. You bought your land just about a year ago (the same time as the Killingsworths)
            when the original farm was sub-divided and sold
          - >
            You are a retired psychiatrist. You lived in Los Angeles for many years and brought mental peace to many big
            name stars, but you have a strict policy against name-dropping. While most of your patients droned on and on
            about their boring problems, you daydreamed about murder and mayhem. Soon you completed a mystery novel
            that sold very well Gust 17 books away from the top ten best-seller list) and allowed you to move to Marcocain
            and focus on writing a sequel.   
          - >
            Your husband is currently overseas on business, but that does not stop you from socializing. You enjoy your
            newfound fame and often host parties for the cream of the society's crop. In fact, you came to Killingsworth
            Farm today to ask if you could use some of Elizabeth's farmland for extra valet parking for your party next week.
        secrets:
          - >
            The novel that made you famous also made you a social outcast m Los Angeles. Your fictional novel about a
            celebrity murder was assumed by some to be based on fact — facts you were told by your celebrity patients. As
            rumors of your sources surfaced, your career plunged. Celebrity clients found new psychiatrists and you had no
            work. Invitations stopped arriving. You were blackballed. You had to move.     
          - >
            With your husband constantly away, the pressures of social climbing alone can be too much. You like to find
            relief in the arms of the hot farm hand next door. But he is not the only one you have been having an affair with.
          - >
            You fell in love with Robert Killingsworth before he died. He had promised to leave Elizabeth for you, but when
            she discovered your tryst, Robert felt so ashamed that he decided to work it out with Elizabeth and save their
            marriage. He died only days later..
      Enrique Graves:
        information:
          - >
            You work on the Killingsworth Farm helping with the crop and doing odd jobs as needed. Little is known of your
            past, and you like to keep it that way. A year ago, you were a drifter with no ambition. While hitchhiking to
            Mexico you camped for the night in the Killingsworth's Barn. Elizabeth found you the next morning, but rather
            than kick you out, she took a liking to you and allowed you to stay on the farm if you worked for your keep. You
            have been working the farm ever since.
          - >
            Encouraged and financed by Elizabeth, you have even returned to college (you dropped out of Hoboken College -
            in New Jersey - as a freshman). You seem to have really turned yourself around. You work days and spend
            nights in school or at the library where you have become good friends with Kathryn, the librarian.          
          - >  
            Life was really looking good. until Robert died. Now that the farm is going under, you are worried that you will
            have to drop out of college again and do who knows what for a living.
        secrets:
          - >
            You did not drop out of Hoboken College. You were kicked out of school after being arrested for selling drugs to
            an undercover police officer. You spent only a little time in jail, but it was enough for your family to disown you.          
            With nobody to turn to, you headed out west — everyone heads out west eventually — to make a name for yourself
            and show them back home that you ARE somebody.
          - >
            You enjoy your new lifestyle with a cushy job and free education, but you cannot escape the power of drugs and
            still indulge in them frequently. You even grow your own marijuana crop down near the barn by the lake.
          - >
            For English class, you are writing a paper on the history of the town. Since Kathryn is an amateur historian, you
            have worked out a deal — she does the research that you need, and you keep her company on lonely nights.
          - >
            Kathryn is not the only one with whom you are having an affair. While Kathryn does your homework, you are
            free for more pleasurable pursuits. The psychiatrist next door seems to like to play when her husband is away. <br />
            You have seen her bedroom on more than one occasion.
      Kathryn Lawless:
        tasks:
          - Introduce yourself.
        information:
          - >
            You are Elizabeth Killingsworth's best friend. Elizabeth often volunteered at the local library where, for the last
            ten years, you have been the head (and only) librarian. You are unmarried, but have several nieces and nephews
            on which you dote almost as much as your fifteen cats.
          - >
            Not only are you the town's librarian, but it's historian (and biggest gossip) as well. It is almost impossible to
            keep a secret in such a small town and you are proud of the fact that you know everything about everybody. You
            have read every novel by Agatha Christie, Patricia Cornwell and, of course, Lilian Jackson Braun (The Cat
            Who... series). Sometimes, on rainy days, you feel like picking up a Steven King.
          - >
            Today, you dropped by the Killingsworth Farm to visit Elizabeth and savor a nice cup of tea. You are sad that
            Elizabeth is selling the farm and are going to miss her terribly when she moves back to the East Coast.
        secrets:
          - >
            Enrique, the Killingsworth Farm farmhand, is writing a paper on the history of the town for his college English
            course. He came to you one day and worked out a deal — you do the research he needs, and he keeps you company
            on lonely nights. He is beautiful, and you are single... In the back of your mind, though, you know he is only
            using you.
          - >
            As you dug deeper into the history of Marcocain, you uncovered an Interesting story about the previous owner of
            Killingsworth Farm who discovered a gold vein on the property. With a little more research using that new-
            fangled Internet thing you figured out that the farmer died before mining the gold, and it could still be buried on
            the land. You called the one nephew you have in real estate to come and buy the farm from Elizabeth and sell it
            to you for at a small profit. You like Elizabeth, but the thought of such a great deal of money and a life outside
            this small town is too tempting.
      Michael Nightshade:
        tasks:
          - Introduce yourself.
        information:
          - >
            You have come from New York to California on business. Business is your life and your cellular telephone is
            almost a permanent fixture in your hand. As a land development consultant, you've been hired by the state of
            California to find an inexpensive tract of land to develop into a low-cost housing project. <br />
            When you are not working (a rare occurrence) you enjoy hitting the clubs. You are young and energetic and quite
            charismatic. The ladies tend to fawn over you, but you suspect that is because of the 2.6 million dollars you made
            last year in land development. If you can pull off this job for the state of California, you may even become a
            partner in your firm. Unfortunately, the state has given you a minuscule budget with which to acquire and
            develop the land. It was almost a dream-come-true to find the Killingsworth Farm available under the current
            market value. Elizabeth's misfortune was your good fortune. You hoped that she would see that your mission
            was for a good cause and give you an even better deal. <br />
            You arrived today without an appointment. You saw the real estate listing in the newspaper and rushed right
            over. <br />
            You have spent much of the day surveying the Killingsworth Farm and have sketched out a map of the area. <br />
        secrets:
          - >
            You are not Michael Nightshade, land developer. You are Michael Nightshade, junior executive trainee at a real
            estate brokerage firm in New York City. You do not have millions of dollars, but you are charismatic and can
            easily convince others that you are made of money.
          - >
            You have never been to California before which is exactly why your Aunt Kathryn Lawless insisted you come.
            You know that she is crazy, and she wouldn't give you exact details, but she told you that there would be a lot of
            money in it for you if you could get Elizabeth Killingsworth to sell the farm to you and you sell it in turn to her.
            Katherine insisted, however, that you keep her identity and your relationship to her a secret. But why?
        revelations:

        information:
          - >
            You grew up in the same city as Elizabeth (Jersey City, New Jersey). It was through her that you met her sister,
            Vicki. You and Vicki instantly fell in love and eloped as soon as she turned 18. You currently work - are
            overworked actually —as a real estate broker in New York City. You and Vicki have decided to take a vacation to
            get away from the hustle and bustle of your daily lives and maybe even fall in love all over again.
          - >
            For the last week, you have been traveling around the country 111 your new RV. You arrived at Killingsworth
            Farms yesterday to visit your sister-in-law.
          - >
            In your spare time, you are an amateur ornithologist. You almost never go out without your binoculars and look
            forward to looking around Killingsworth Farms for interesting birds.
        secrets:
          - >
            You feel trapped in your current life. You married Vicki so young... Actually, you first dated her sister,
            Elizabeth. Elizabeth was a virgin and would not let you get past first base with her. Elizabeth's sister, Vicki,
            however, was quite different she exuded sexuality. It was not long before Vicki seduced you. After Vicki
            became pregnant, however, you eloped and have been with her ever since. You know that when Vicki stole you
            from Elizabeth, it tore the two apart and they have not spoken since.
          - >  
            You travel around with your binoculars to look at birds, but use the binoculars for so much more. You and Vicki
            are not close at all, so you must get your sexual thrills whatever way you can — a little voyeurism here, an affair
            there... As for this vacation, it is not really a vacation at all. You are currently on administrative leave from your
            job as a real estate broker for sexually harassing the office receptionist. To make matters worse, you now have no
            way to cover up the evidence that you've been skimming money from your real estate transactions (Vicki lives
            way beyond your means — man, you hate her). You have kept the sexual harassment suit and the skimming from
            the company a secret from Vicki. You told her that you need money for gambling debts. You had to sell your
            house to return most of the money to the company, but it isn't enough. Times are getting desperate.
            Your hope was to visit Elizabeth and ask for a loan to get you through the next couple of months. Or maybe even
            to get her to fall in love with you again. Whatever it takes.

            You are the (one year) younger sister of Elizabeth. As a child, you adored your older sister and were the best of
            friends. As she grew older, however, and discovered boys, the two of you drifted apart from each other. When
            Elizabeth married Robert Killingsworth and moved to California, you lost touch completely. After graduating
            high school, you mamed your high school sweetheart, Norman, and remained in your hometown of Jersey City,
            New Jersey. Currently you are a part time homemaker taking care of your three boys and also work part time at
            the make-up counter of the mall's department store. You are hopelessly addicted to daytime soap operas and talk
            shows. Your claim to fame is that you once appeared on the Gerry Springer Show — the episode titled "What I'd
            Do For a Buck" is still the talk of the beauty shop.
          - >
            You and Norman have been traveling around the country In your new RV. Yesterday, you arrived at
            Killingsworth Farms. You were hoping to take this opportunity to build a better relationship with your sister.
        secrets:
          - >
            Elizabeth has not spoken to you in years — ever since you stole her high school boyfriend, Norman. You hated the
            fact that she was in love with Norman and stopped spending time with you. Not only did Elizabeth despise you
            for stealing Norman from her, but your parents resented it as well. At age 18 you secretly eloped with Norman
            and have lived with him ever since. You do not love Norman, but with three kids and no college education, you
            feel trapped. Norman, unfortunately, is an insecure loser. He has a gambling problem, and owes money to some
            very powerful people. You have a plan to get out of this terrible situation, though. You have decided to drop by
            on Elizabeth and tell her that Norman was abusive to you in hopes of getting a loan, dumping dumb Norman, and
            moving out on your own — perhaps to California and become a soap opera actress... no... soap opera diva!

            mood still lingers in the air. Where is Elizabeth Killingsworth? You feel ill at ease with this strange group of
            uninvited guests. One of the other guests — you do not notice who suggests the group split up to find Elizabeth.
            You wonder about the people around you and the circumstances that brought each person to Killingsworth Farm
            today. As the group begins to spread in different directions in search of Elizabeth, you decide to use this

            While tending my garden around noon, I noticed Michael Nightshade drive up to Killingsworth Farm. 
            Being curious, I watched as he went to the door and talked with Elizabeth Killingsworth on the front porch.
            Through an open window of the farmhouse, I saw Kathryn Lawless rooting through a medicine cabinet in the bathroom.
            She took something that looked like a small pill bottle and put it into her pocket. By 12: 15, she joined Elizabeth
            and Michael on the front porch.

            I have spent much of the week in the library doing research. I have seen Enrique Graves there a number of

            Around 9:30 AM this morning, I was cleaning the farmhouse windows from outside when I heard Vicki
            D'Adly sobbing and speaking to someone. She was in the breakfast room at the time.
          - >
            When Robert Killingsworth died, Elizabeth felt alone and distraught. She had no other living family except her
            sister, whom she said she had not seen since high school. Elizabeth wanted to make amends with her sister, but
            said that she never wanted to see her brother-in-law again. She never made contact with her sister.

            Around 12:45 PM, Dr. Chelsea Barren came to you and asked about the man who had driven up to Killingsworth
            Farm (Michael Nightshade). You did a little snooping for her and found out that he was a real estate developer
            who intended to buy the farm to develop it into low-cost housing. You reported this news back to Dr. Barren at
            about I PM. She seemed horrified by the thought of low-cost housing next to her property. She vowed to put a
            stop to the plan.
            You have been at the library a lot this week as Kathryn Lawless has been helping you with your homework.
            Elizabeth Killingsworth was especially attentive and generous to you immediately following Robert's death. You
            think that she was afraid you would leave the farm and she would be alone.

            I recognize Dr. Chelsea Barren from her book cover. Her last novel was nearly a best seller but was
            surrounded in controversy. I recall hearing that she was sued over it. I wonder if she is still writing.
          - >
            I went into the town Library early this morning to shelve books and water the plants. As I was leaving,
            I noticed Norman in the gift shop next door. The cashier placed a few items into Norman's bag. I am
            certain that one of them was made of gold.
          - >
            At morning coffee with Elizabeth, she showed me a corkscrew that Norman had given to her just half an hour
            earlier. Elizabeth seemed very flustered by the gift. She did not seem to realize that it was still in her hands when
            the doorbell rang at Noon.
          - >
            I recall that Enrique Graves seemed to have a lot more disposable income after Robert Killingsworth's death
            spending more time on his car and friends and less time at the library.

            At noon, Michael Nightshade arrived to consider buying the Killingsworth Farm. You were not feeling well at

            some antacid.

            I arrived at Killingsworth Farm at noon. I approached the house to ask Elizabeth Killingsworth if I
            could look around the grounds and she seemed very happy to oblige. In fact, she almost seemed desperate to
            show you around. Behind Elizabeth, I could see Kathryn Lawless who came out to join me on the front porch
            at about 12:15.
          - >
            While Elizabeth and I were walking around the grounds, I noticed that she was carrying around a small
            object. I did not think she even realized that she was carrying it as she had been so engrossed in talking about
            the farm. At about I PM, we were in the Rose Garden when a bee stung Elizabeth. She dropped the object
            she was carrying in the grass and ran back inside the house. I followed her.

            While searching for the missing Elizabeth, I entered her bedroom and found a small shrine dedicated to her late

            While bird watching around at 12:45 PM, I noticed Enrique Graves stalking around. He seemed to be secretly
            observing something. I did not want to pry, so I continued walking.

            I gave Michael Nightshade my resume and told him of my background in real estate. Michael told me that

            I have heard that Dr. Chelsea Barren is writing a novel about a man who was bludgeoned to death and dumped into a

            her life for good.

            You met Elizabeth Killingsworth for a private breakfast this morning at around 9:30 AM. You mentioned that

            Almost as soon as all of the guests split up in search of the missing Elizabeth Killingsworth, the sound of
            screaming draws everyone deep into the labyrinth that makes up the Killingsworth Wine Vault — an expansive
            wine storage facility behind the Killingsworth Farmhouse. The lights will not turn on and only a sliver of
            moonlight shines through the window. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see a body face down in a large
            pool of blood. Your intuition tells you that you have found the body of Elizabeth Killingsworth. <br />
            The darkness of the Wine Vault makes an examination of the body impossible. The group decides to return to the
            main house to call the police. You suspect someone in this group is responsible for the murder of Elizabeth
            Killingsworth, and you have a few questions to ask.

            Six months ago, you were the last person to see Robert Killingsworth alive. You met Robert for lunch at

            publisher. Robert was very much alive at the time when you left.

            You are sleeping with Enrique Graves. After your usual 3:00 PM tryst in the Wine Vaults, you noticed a piece of
            paper had fallen out of his pocket. You picked it up to look at it and headed straight to the Farmhouse to find
            Elizabeth Killingsworth.

            When Norman and Vicki D'Adly arrived last night, I helped them with some luggage from their RV. I
            noticed the RV was filled with boxes — much more than two people would ever need on vacation.
            At about 3:00 PM, I was fixing the wiring in the Wine Vaults when Dr. Chelsea Barren joined me. I have
            been sleeping around with Dr. Barren, but know that she is just using me to get information about the
            Killingsworths for her next book.

            You have lost a page of pin-codes and bank information. You suspect Dr. Barren took it from you this afternoon.
            You had not realized that she was that hard up for money.
            You have a special friendship with Kathryn Lawless. She writes your college papers for you in return for
            spending evenings with her. As librarian, she has access to valuable historical reference materials — some of
            which you stole in hopes of selling for extra cash.
      Kathryn Lawless:
        revelations:
          - >
            I knew Robert Killingsworth well. He was a strong and capable man. The fact that he was bludgeoned to
            death is unsettling. His killer must have surprised him — or tricked him. Who was the last person to see him
            alive?
          - >
            Around 1 PM, the Killingsworth telephone rang and I answered it. It was a law firm calling for Norman.
            He was on the phone in the study for the next hour and a half. I listened into the phone call and heard Norman
            talking to a lawyer about a sexual harassment lawsuit and something about embezzlement.

            At 1 PM, Dr. Chelsea Barren joined me, Vicki D'Adly, and Elizabeth for lunch at the Killingsworth
            Farmhouse. Though Elizabeth tried to change the subject many times, the conversation mainly revolved around
            Michael Nightshade wanting to turn the farm into a low cost housing development. Dr. Barren was very unhappy
            about the prospects.

            You are very attracted to Enrique and have been sleeping with him. You also do his homework for him. You

            early founder of Marcocain. He died shortly after the letter was written when he drown in a lake on his property.
          - >  
            You are quite infatuated with Enrique Graves — almost to the point of stalking him. After performing a
            background check on him via the Internet, you discovered that he had been arrested for selling drugs to an under-
            cover police officer over a year ago. Apparently, he skipped town after serving a short jail sentence.

            At 3 PM, Elizabeth had not come back out of the farmhouse, so I decided to look around the farm on my
            own. At about 3:15 PM, I saw a woman enter the Wine Vaults. I could see Enrique Graves inside the door
            and the two were speaking conspiratorially. I walked away and did not see when the woman came out of the
            Wine Vaults.

            Kathryn Lawless is your Aunt. She gave you the tip to come to California to buy the Killingsworth Farm. You

          - >
            She did not tell you why, but seemed quite eager to get her hands on the land. It is all moot, however, because
            Elizabeth was asking more for the farm than you could afford. You spent much of the day making calls to get
            more money and talking to Elizabeth to get her to lower her price.

            Around 3 PM, I overhead a heated conversation between Elizabeth Killingsworth and Dr. Chelsea Barren.
            Elizabeth was telling Chelsea that she would rather deny any evidence in the murder of Robert Killingsworth than
            let Chelsea expose any of it in her book.

            During your conversation at 10:30 AM this morning with Elizabeth in the Rose Garden, she told you that Vicki

            Vicki. <br />
            You received a phone call today at 1:00 PM from your boss. For the last couple of weeks, you have been on
            administrative leave for sexual harassing your office receptionist. While performing necessary checks for the
            upcoming lawsuit, your boss had found evidence that you had been siphoning money from the company Into your

            At 1 PM, Dr. Chelsea Barren seemed to invite herself to lunch with Kathryn Lawless, Elizabeth, and myself. I
            could sense that Elizabeth was uncomfortable. She admitted to you later that she hates Dr. Chelsea Barren.
          - >  
            During lunch, I took a peek through Dr. Barren's notebook and noticed her notes regarding Robert
            Killingsworth's murder. Dr. Barren seems to think that Robert was killed in his own home - a drop of blood was
            found on the carpet in front of his study computer, his files had been rifled through, and his phone was off of the
            hook. Elizabeth believes the bloodstain had been there for years. She could not explain the disarray of the phone
            or papers, however.

            Michael Nightshade looks very familiar and I finally recognize him. I met him last year at Norman's

            You lied to Elizabeth th1S morning at breakfast. You told her that Norman was physically abusive to you, but
            your lies were just an attempt to gain Elizabeth's sympathy. You partially wanted to see how she would react to
            the news, but also to see if she still had feelings for Norman. Elizabeth did seem surprised that Norman was
            abusive, but she told you that you got what you deserved. You want to divorce Norman, but you rely on him too
            much financially.

            paths formed by the stacked oak barrels of wine and almost get lost. Coming upon the body, you confirm that it
            is, in fact, Elizabeth Killingsworth, and you immediately see the cause of her death. A golden corkscrew juts
            from the right side of her neck. There appears to be something inscribed on the corkscrew, but the pool of blood
            prevents you from getting close enough to the body for a closer inspection. <br />
            The sight of Elizabeth's body is too gruesome for some of the guests and you decide to return, once again, to the

            porch of Killingsworth Farmhouse watching me, but I followed Vicki into the Wine Vault anyway. I
            trailed her as she made her way through the labyrinth of halls never letting her out of my sight.

            marriage. Robert broke off his affair with you immediately. He died only days later.

            At 6:30 PM, I went to the Wine Vault to work on the short in the wiring. I was sure that I turned off the

            next quarter of an hour. The jolt of electricity must have shorted out the lights in the Wine Vault.

            Dr. Chelsea Barren was almost as devastated by Robert Killingsworth's death as Elizabeth. I wonder just why

            At 5:15 PM, I met with Elizabeth Killingsworth again. Together, we found a cozy corner in the Wine Vaults
            to sample various wines and discuss the sale of Killingsworth Farm. we were still drinking together when the
            lights flickered and went out. We heard some one screaming from the other end of the Wine Vaults. Elizabeth
            Killingsworth told me to wait there while she went and investigated. That was the last time I saw her alive.

            You demanded that your Aunt Kathryn tell you why she wanted you to pretend to be a real estate developer to try

            gold buried on the land worth millions. Her plans to obtain the land seemed deranged, but she kept saying that
            she was desperate to leave this small town and promising you a nice profit from the deal.

            At 2:15 PM, Kathryn Lawless sneaked out to your car with a bottle of sleeping pills. She told you to crush them

            I had just finished a business phone call in the study when I saw Kathryn Lawless approach Michael

            conversation and I am certain that I heard Michael Nightshade say, "Are you sure about this, Aunt
            Kathryn?" She then handed him a small pill bottle.

            I was bird watching most of the afternoon. I was out in the grape fields when you noticed the Wine

            this small town to live an exciting life — and that she was going to do something about it. She did not elaborate,
            though. She only grinned and laughed — almost maniacally.

            At about 6:45 PM, you decided to go find Enrique again. You did not see him outside, so decided to check the

            same time you saw him, however, you heard a loud popping sound. The lights flickered and went out. You

            My life has revolved around books. That is why I became a librarian. Some people, however,
            might call me a dreamer. I will admit that I have always longed for a more exciting life.<br />
            Tonight has been especially exciting for me. For once, I do not have to be content just reading a
            mystery in one of my library books. I can finally live the adventure.<br />
            As a mystery novel fan, I've learned the crucial factors in solving any murder. The killer must
            have a motive to murder, the means to commit the crime, and the opportunity to do so.<br />
            I was Elizabeth Killingsworth's best friend. I would never have dreamed of killing her. In fact, I
            could not have killed her. We know that Elizabeth was murdered in the Wine Vaults this
            evening. I was nowhere near the Wine Vaults today.<br />
            Furthermore, Elizabeth was found with a corkscrew jutting out of her neck. Earlier today,
            Elizabeth told me that Norman D'Adly had given that same corkscrew to her as a gift. He had
            even inscribed it to her. Elizabeth mentioned that she dropped the corkscrew in the Rose Garden
            today after being stung by a bee. She rushed back to the Farmhouse for treatment. The time was
            1 PM.<br />
            Only the people who were in the Rose Garden today would have had access to the murder
            weapon used to kill Elizabeth. I am innocent.<br />

      Michael Nightshade:
        revelations:
          - >
            I was in the Rose Garden this afternoon with Elizabeth Killingsworth. She was showing me
            around the Farm. I probably could have picked up the corkscrew when Elizabeth dropped it, but
            I did not do so. My mind was elsewhere. <br />
            I am not exactly who I appear to be. And I am not the only one. My Aunt, Kathryn Lawless, is
             not exactly the best friend to Elizabeth that she would make us believe.<br />
            I am not a real estate developer. I am a junior executive trainee at a real estate brokerage in New
            York City. I came to see Elizabeth in order to buy her farm inexpensively. While helping
            Enrique Graves with his college research, Kathryn uncovered clues to millions of dollars in gold
            somewhere in the Killingsworth Farm fields. This was a secret she kept even from me.<br />
            Kathryn and I first planned to buy Elizabeth's farm outright — I was to buy the farm and sell it to
            Kathryn afterwards at a tidy profit. Unfortunately, Elizabeth's asking price was much more than
            I could afford on my modest salary.<br />
            Unable to persuade Elizabeth to lower her selling-price enough, Kathryn decided to take our plan
            to the next level. She was desperate to escape her mundane life here in Marcocain and obtaining
            the gold on the Killingsworth Farm would have provided her with the financial freedom to
            pursue all of her life's dreams.<br />
            While I was out seeing the grounds with Elizabeth, Kathryn stole some sleeping pills from
            Elizabeth's medicine cabinet and slipped them to me later while I was making phone calls from
            my car.<br />
            I crushed the sleeping pills and slipped them into Elizabeth's wine while we were wine-tasting in
            the vaults just before she was killed. Kathryn had forged a suicide note for Elizabeth with
            instructions that Kathryn should be given the Killingsworth Farm. Kathryn was trying to get the
            farm for free and leave me completely out of the picture - without even having made a profit
            selling the land to her. Had I known that Kathryn was trying to give me the shaft, I would never
            have gone along with her crazy plan. I admit that I tried to kill Elizabeth, but somebody else got
            to her first. I certainly did not stab her in the neck with a corkscrew.<br />

            <p>Well, I was certainly fooled by Michael Nightshade's deception. I was terrified that he was
            going to turn the Killingsworth Farm into low-cost housing. I have already lost my practice and
            book deals. If Elizabeth sold her farm, my property value would have plummeted. I would have
            had nothing left. I would be completely broke. But I would not have killed Elizabeth over a few
            dollars. I am a doctor, after all.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, I had always suspected that Elizabeth Killingsworth murdered her husband,
            Robert, six months ago. I loved Robert and had been having an affair with him. When his death
            went unsolved, I made it my mission to expose Elizabeth as his killer and make the story my
            next best-selling book.</p>
            <p>I had assumed that Elizabeth had killed Robert for his life insurance, but I was surprised to see
            her even worse off financially after his death.</p>
            <p>I have been sleeping with Enrique Graves, the farmhand, in order to gain inside information into
            Elizabeth's life. Today, I struck gold! I found a clue to Robert's killer. I found a list of bank
            records, pin codes, and financial transactions from immediately after Robert's death. I was
            shocked to learn that it was not Elizabeth who killed Robert. I came to her with this evidence,
            but she would not accept it. Anyway, you can read in my next book who killed Robert
            Killingsworth. As for Elizabeth, however, I am baffled.</p>

      Enrique Graves:
        revelations:

            I never liked Robert Killingsworth, Elizabeth's husband, and he never liked me. He was jealous
            of my relationship with Elizabeth. Even though our relationship was never physical, she adored
            me. <br />
            Robert did not trust me — for good reason. I did not drop out of college a year ago. I was kicked
            out for drug possession and for attempting to sell marijuana to an undercover police officer. This
            was an offense for which I was arrested. After serving a short jail sentence, I headed West to
            California. <br />
            I really was doing well for myself here. Elizabeth had me enrolled in College and I had that
            librarian, Kathryn Lawless, so wrapped around my little finger that she was doing all the work
            for me. <br />
            Robert Killingsworth, however, had tried to ruin everything for me. He did some searching into
            my past and discovered my arrest. As fate would have it, Robert decided to confront me just as I
            was searching through his bank files in his study for a way to get at the Killingsworth money.
            Robert was enraged and tried to call the police. I could not let that happen. As soon as he turned
            around to pick up the phone, I grabbed a candlestick from the fireplace mantle and hit him over
            the head. I dumped Robert's lifeless body into Friedmont Mill Lake, but I should have weighted
            it down. Robert's body surfaced two weeks later. I cleaned the murder weapon and disposed of
            it by giving it to Kathryn Lawless as a birthday present. If Elizabeth ever found out that I killed
            her husband, I would have had to kill her too. <br />
            Vicki D'Adly and I were in the Rose Garden fooling around tonight around 5:30 PM. Either one
            of us could have found the corkscrew. There is only my word, however, that I did not find it.
            Besides, I was unconscious at the time that Elizabeth was killed. I had been working on the
            wiring short in the Wine Vault when I was nearly electrocuted and blacked-out. Vicki can attest
            to that. There is no way I could have killed Elizabeth Killingsworth. <br />

            I did see Enrique Graves get shocked and fall unconscious. That is true. It is also true that I was
            with him in the Rose Garden at 5:30 PM and could have had access to the corkscrew.
            I will be the first to admit that my sister and I did not get a long. Until this weekend, Elizabeth
            Killingsworth and I have been estranged since high school when I stole her boyfriend away and
            married him. What a mistake that was! Recently, we had to sell hour house because Norman
            was sued for sexual harassing a co-worker. I also know that he has been stealing from his
            company to pay his debts. <br />
            I do not want to be married to Norman any longer. Even after I lied to Elizabeth and told her that
            Norman was beating me, she would not — or could not — give me a loan to start a new life.
            I was more appalled to find out that Norman still loved Elizabeth and was scheming to become a
            part of her life again. <br />
            It dawned on me that if I killed Elizabeth, I would be her closest living relative and would inherit
            her money. I would then be free to move to Hollywood to become a star. The only downside is
            that I would have had to share the money with Norman. A more sensible plan, I decided, would
            be to divorce Norman before knocking off Elizabeth. <br />
            I believe that Dr. Chelsea Barren was spying on me at the time of Elizabeth's death. She can
            attest to the fact that I did not kill my sister. <br />

            I have never stopped loving Elizabeth Killingsworth. Even after marrying her sister, Vicki, I
            could never stop thinking of Elizabeth. I came to Killingsworth Farm not only because my job
            was in jeopardy and I needed a loan, but because I wanted to leave Vicki and marry Elizabeth.
            I bought Elizabeth the golden corkscrew as a gift and told her of my intentions. Elizabeth,
            however, said she could never forgive me for leaving her so many years ago. I still loved
            Elizabeth and hoped that one day we would be together again. For the time being, however, I
            found myself stuck with Vicki to whom I despise being married. <br />
            I was at the Gazebo in the Rose Garden tonight when I saw Vicki kissing the farmhand, Enrique
            Graves. I was so enraged that I wanted them dead that very moment. I saw the corkscrew that I
            had given to Elizabeth laying in the grass and believed it was a sign. I slipped the corkscrew into
            my pocket. <br />
            After a few minutes, Enrique and Vicki split up and left the Rose Garden. I followed Enrique to
            the Wine Vault and watched him turn off the electricity from the main power switch in the rear
            of the building. He then walked down a maze of halls and he began working on some exposed
            wires. Doubling back, I returned to the electrical box and turned on the electricity. I heard a
            sharp crack of electricity and the lights went dark. I could hear Vicki scream. She must have
            seen Enrique get shocked. <br />
            Fumbling down the passageways, I made my way toward the sound of Vicki's scream. Suddenly
            I was standing behind her. I pulled the corkscrew from my pocket and slammed it into the side
            of her neck. She fell to the floor - her blood spilling everywhere. <br />
            I ran back to the Farmhouse to figure out what to do next when I found everyone gathering in the
            main hall. To my horror, Vicki stood among the group of strangers. That is when I realized my
            terrible mistake. I did not know that Elizabeth was in the Wine Vault. Elizabeth must have been
            wandering the halls following Vicki's scream. In the dark I assumed she was Vicki, as they look
            nearly identical even in good lighting. I thought I was killing my wife, but instead, killed the
            only woman I've ever truly loved. I killed Elizabeth Killingsworth.<br />
