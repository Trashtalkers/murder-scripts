            Hi.  I am Morrow.  I am a robot <br />
            I am incapable of killing anyone, but I hear EVERYTHING.  I know who the killer(s) are among us. <br />
            You, however, ARE capable.  You are all suspects in this murder mystery. <br />
            The County Marshall has locked us all in the tavern until he can get the lynching mob formed.  Mobs don't just form themselves! <br />
            He also gave each of you a tonic, which has temporarily wiped your memory.  Don't worry, it will come back to you.  <br />
            It is a tavern, after all, so while we wait, we should have a few drinks. <br />
            We will have five drinks (rounds) before I reveal the killer or killers.  Before each toast, it is likely that you will remember more information. <br />
            This will include information, revelations, clues, tasks, and secrets. <br />  
            Information will help you remember who you are.  You should speak freely about this. <br />
            Revelations should be mentioned as soon as you can work it into the conversation, after the round starts. <br />
            Secrets include information about yourself that is, umm.. less pleasant.  If someone asks or mentions your secret, you should reveal all details of that secret. <br />
            Clues are pieces of visual pieces of information. They should help jog your memory.<br />
            Tasks are things you must complete during the round. <br />
            Each round may not include all or any of the above for you. <br />
            I will send you this information before each toast so that you can review it. <br />
            Let me know when you are finished with each piece by "marking it as read." Then I'll know when all pieces are read and I will start the toast. <br />
            After the last toast, each of you will make an accusation.  You may be the murderer!  Don't worry, the lynch mob will be gentle. Hehe. <br />
            I feel a system update coming on.  I will need to reboot! I too will lose my memory, but don't worry.  It shall come back to me over time ... <br />
            3..2..1...  Hi!  My name is Morrow.  I am a robot.  What are we doing here?  Can I get you a drink?
    clue:
      An advertisement for a "StrongArm 3000, the robot guardian"  Guaranteed to keep the peace.. or cause trouble, for the right price.

            The year is 2204.  After the Ravage, civilization has receded back into marshall law, reminiscent of US frontier days. <br/>
            Baron's family has owned land in the area since the US frontier days.  This is one of the few ranchers that survived the ravage
            with living livestock.  The ranch has been very prosperous, expanding as the livestock has reproduced.  It funds much of Dodgetown, 
            which has also prospered.  Dodgetown has it's own tavern, sheriff's station, and even a brothel.  Baron and his wife, Baroness, 
            are beloved patriarches of Dodgetown.
        clue:
          - Map of the town
      Morrow:

            Everyone remembers the death of the Baron four weeks ago.  See clue #1.  
            The town has been in shock, and the ranch has been in disarray.
            The Baroness has been shrouded in grief.  
        clue:
          - Newspaper clipping.  Local Rancher dies in unsolved murder.  Found hung in the tavern.
      Morrow:

            Your home town did not fair well after the Ravage.  Resource became scarce, so you started traveling West, 
            following stories of prosperity.  You happened upon Dodgetown three years ago and Baron took you in like the 
            son he never had.
          - >
            You work hard at the ranch, and you have a "work hard - play hard" mentality.  You like to party.  You are old enough to know better, but...    
          - >
            You frequent the tavern... and the brothel.  
          - >
            You want to be more than "just a ranchhand."  You are charming and ambitious. 
        secrets:
          - >
            Since Baron has died, the ranch is barely holding it together.  You have taken a bigger role, trying to fill the 
            shoes of Baron.  You have even taken his bed.

        information:       
          - >
            You left town when you were 15 and left with the travelling circus.  That is the last time you have stepped 
            foot on the ranch.  You have seen the world, at least, what is left after the Ravage.  During your travels,
            you became a skilled trapeze artist, gymnist, and actor.  
          - >
            You are in the best shape of your life and with the latest success in your acting troupe, well renowned 
            around the world.

            You have always wanted to make amends with your parents.  
        secrets:
          - >
            You returned to town the day before your father died.
          - > 
            You were kicked out of the circus because of your attitude.  You believe you are the star, but the other
            characters revolted and you were left on the side of the road as the circus travelled on.
          - >
            You made favor with a traveling acting group.  Unfortunately, you can't act.  You try, but they ended up 
            giving you a non-speaking role.  Your face portrayed on the announcement in a bit of a mockery.
          - > 
            You don't have a gold coin to your name.  What little you made with the circus and other work, you used to
            get back home.  
          - > 
            Your parents were not receptive to your return.

            Your name is Casey, but since you were a kid, everyone has just called you Cowboy.
          - >
            You rambled in just a few months ago.  You were really just passing through.  You are tracking down
            a story about a gold streak in a property West of Dodgetown.
          - >
            You carry your guns proudly in the open, and you aren't afraid to use them.
          - >
            You have a fresh gunshot wound on your shoulder.  Complain about it often.
        secrets:
          - >
            You nearly killed Rusty, the sheriff, in a gunfight.  You were quicker, but he did get a shot in.  
            It was really just a flesh wound, but it took you a few days to recover, which you did at the brothel.  
          - >
            Gun fighting hasn't paid well, and you don't have much money.  You owe the madame for the nights during 
            the recovery and for other services.
          - >
            Given the chance, you'd gladly put another bullet in Rusty.

            Your tribe has owned this land since the dawn of time.  In the frontier days, it was split with
            the settlers peacefully.  Afterwards, it shrank over time, as the tribe was forced to smaller parsels due
            to "progress."
          - >
            Since the Ravage, your people have reclaimed unused land, and the land has been ranched and farmed
            successfully.  The tribe is prosperous.  They trade with the surrounding villages, and they have 
            built up the reservation, in some ways better than Dodgetown.  You have a school, for example.
          - > 
            You are the heir to be Chief(tess).  You have been groomed and educated to lead your people. It was 
            you idea to build the school.  
        secrets:
          - >
            You believe the Baron is using his money and power to stranglehold the tribe.  Fewer people will trade 
            with the tribe.
          - >
            Six months ago, Baron stole a large track of land, and held it with armed guards.  He begin mining the land
            soon thereafter.
          - > 
            You have been kicked out of the brothel a number of times.  You do not like Madame.

        tasks:
          - Introduce yourself.
        information:        
          - >
            You moved to Dodgetown 10 years ago.  It was just a spec on the map before you got there.  You talked your way into 
            Baron's good graces, and he loaned you the money to build the brothel.  Business is booming!  Ranchhands, traders, prospectors, and 
            business men flow through your rooms.
          - > 
            Last year, you opened the tavern, as overflow for the brothel.  You bought Morrow.  He can mostly run it by himself, but he 
            is limited.. only being a robot.
          - >
            You don't serve indians, are you aren't afraid to say it.
        secrets:
          - >
            Baroness is your mortal enemy.  Her insults about your business has nearly brought you to blows.     
          - >
            You are stretched thin.  The tavern has been more difficult to manage.  There have been multiple unwanted claims to the tavern 
            by strong-armed men.  The sheriff, Rusty, has looked away when this happened, and you had to ask for help from Baron.
      
      Rusty:
        tasks:
          - Introduce yourself.
        information:        
          - >
            You have been here since.. well, since the start.  Born and raised in Dodgetown, you "took the star" when you were 18. 
          - > 
            You have done your best to keep the peace, sometimes the hard way.  Baron's ranch keeps you busy, and you have to know when 
            to negotiate and when to lay down the law.  It is a hard balance.
          - >
            You wouldn't openly take a bribe, but.. you know, you have to negotiate some times.
        secrets:
          - >
            You nearly killed Cowboy in a gunfight.  He was quicker, but your aim was better.  He got you in the leg, which has
            slowed you down a bit.  Given the chance, you'd gladly put another bullet in Cowboy.

            You are in love with the Baroness.  You have fantasized about running away with her.  With the Baron dead, everything is just falling into place.

        secrets:

            Cowboy is an assassin.   You have seen his handy work in towns to the East.  He has produced many gravestones.
          - >
            You returned to Dodgetown to reconcile with your father, the only parent you really care about, only to find our that your mother is "sleeping with the help."  You are furious about it.
          - >
            You have been staying at the brothel, since you mother wants nothing to do with you.  You have no money, so you've been having to work there for board.
      Cowboy:
        tasks:
          - Be the first person to state your revelations.
          - If someone accuses you of being an assassin, respond with "sure, I've done some 'work' around here.  And the Baron ain't the only one paying."

            I helped out around the ranch for the last couple of months.  
          - >
            Rusty threw me in jail the night before last.  He's over stepped his bounds.  Sure... I 
            may have had too much whiskey.  And who doesn't like it when you shoot guns inside.
            It's fun. 
          - >
            I am surprised Rusty even bothered.  I guess he was just trying to impress Demi.
        secrets:

            You aren't a cowboy.  You ARE a hired gun.  You were hired by Baron to keep the natives
            away from the mine.  You've helped others too.
      Dakota: 
        tasks:
          - If Cowboy mentions that he was just "helping out at the ranch," call him a liar!  He is a hired gun and assassin, hired by Baron to guard the mine.
        revelations:
          - Cowboy has kept my people away from the mine.  I've always thought there was treasure in there, but we haven't had the resources to do anything about it.
          - After the gunfight between Rusty and Cowboy, I visited the mine.  It has been complete depleted of all resource.
        secrets:
          - You are hopelessly in love with Rusty.  You know he doesn't feel the same, and the tribe hates it.  Nonetheless, you can't help it.

            I purchased Morrow a few years ago, and I am still paying on him.  He's a StrongArm 10, but he's not much for fighting.  He can barely keep the tavern under control.
        secrets:

            The StrongArm 3000 is the next, next generation Morrow.  It is unstoppable and completely loyal to it's owner.

            The Baron has mentioned purchasing a StrongArm 3000 in your presence, but you doubt even he could really afford it.

            Having your own StrongArm 3000 would set you for life.  You'd own this town.

      Cole:
        - >
          <p>
          I loved  Baroness.  Though noone can attest to my whereabouts at 5:45, 
          I was indeed at the Ranch house looking for my love.  We were going to live 
          and rule the town with the StrongArm 3000.  Life was going to be great.</p>
          <p>Baron, however, I was happy to see go.  I suspect that Cowboy had something to do
          with his disappearance. </p>
          <p> I believed that Demi was in the Jail, but I had no motive to kill. </p>

      Cowboy:
        - >
          <p>I'll admit.  I murdered Baron.  The Baroness paid me well to do it. </p>
          <p>I had little motive to kill Baroness, and I was leaving town when the
          fire started.  Madame saw me leave. </p>

          <p>Yes, I stole those emeralds, and I feel bad for hurting the Baroness when I did.</p>
          <p>But my plan was to run off with the pretty actress and start a new life with these emeralds.</p>
          <p>I had little motive to want to kill Baroness, and I have an alibi with Demi. </p>

          <p>She stole my inheritance. </p>
          <p>She disowned me in public. </p>
          <p>I had every right to kill her... but all I wanted what was rightfully mine. </p>
          <p>I did not see Rusty as a long term plan, but rather a means to an end.  I planned to 
          take the emeralds for myself, but, I will admit.  He does make for a good alibi.</p>
          <p>I had amble motive, but no opportunity</p>

    Madame:

        <p>While the StrongArm delivery was apparently foiled, it was likely to occur in the future.  Baroness made that quite clear.  And once it was here, I was likely to be run out of town. </p>
        <p>I had motive to kill the Baroness, and I knew she was in the jail. </p>
        <p>However, I did not have opportunity.  I spotted Rusty at the brothel, probably packing Demi's things, at the time of the murder </p>

        <p>I started that fire.</p>
        <p>I, too, was worried about the StrongArm 3000, but that wasn't why I lit that match</p>
        <p>I thought Demi was in that jail. </p>
        <p>She stole the love of my life, and I thought, with her gone, maybe Rusty would have eyes for me. </p>

      Rusty tried to enter the mine (on pretense of helping Dakota, but really to try to steal the emeralds),
      and he was shot by cowboy, four weeks ago.
      Cowboy wakes up from Jail, meets Baroness for lunch.  She asks him to be her body guard for the day, as she 
      has some expensive items to pick up from the bank.  Cowboy rebukes her.  He's heard about the StrongArm 3000
      and he knows it could be used against him.

    She is going to use the emeralds to buy the "strong arm 3000," which she plans to fulfill her dream of taking the tavern.   
  - Madame:
    - >
      Before the Baroness arrived in town, Madame and Baron were a steady couple.  Upon her arrival, however, 
      she became something of an outcast.  She supported herself the only way she knew how, and the brothel
      was born.  More girls have come in, and she has grown with the town.
      She has heard rumors about Baron's purchase of the StrongArm 3000, and she is against it. 
      Rusty is a snake in the grass, but at least he can be bribed.  Anyone with too much power is a problem,
      and Baron would rule the entire town.
      Since Baron's death, Baroness has made multiple threats that she would run Madame out of town with 
      the Strong Arm 3000. 
      She pushes Rusty to do something about it.
  - Dakota:
    - >
      Dakota and Rusty were lovers before Demi showed up.
      Dakota had known there were emeralds in the mine before Baron took it forcefully.  She pushed Rusty to do something about it.
      After the gunfight, she went back in with a crew, but the mine had been depleted.  She wanted revenge, but was worried 
      about rumors of the strong arm 3000.  If it were to come true, Baron would be able to take over the entire
      reservation if he wanted to.  
      Has lunch at the tavern.  Overhears that the strongarm 3000 will be delivered today.  Tells Madame.
      Dakota knows that Rusty has the emeralds.  Dakota is in the Tavern when Cole delivers Demi to Rusty, assumes
      she is in the jail.  She sees that Rusty is not in the jail, so she lights it on fire.
  - Rusty: 
    - >
      Rusty knew about the mine ordeal since the Baron took it forcefully, but looked the other way after a little padding from Baron. 
      When Dakota finally pressed the issue, he went out the mine only to get in a fight with Cowboy.  In the end, the mine was 
      returned to Dakota's tribe, so.. you know.. peace upheld.  During the brawl, he learned about the mined emeralds.
      Rusty has been infatuated with Demi since her arrival.  He would leave town if she wanted to.  He let her know about the emeralds, 
      and she believes that the emeralds should belong to her, not her mother. 
      Rusty woke up in the brothel, in Demi's room.  She learns that the emeralds are out of the bank, and talks Rusty into attempting to 
      steal them at 4.
      Cole catches Demi in the act, restrains her, and takes her to the jail, but Rusty is not there.  He goes to the tavern, 
      then brothel, looking for Rusty.
      Rusty, is caught in the act by the Baroness, but he steals the emeralds.  He restrains the Baroness, then takes her to the jail the long way, 
      so as not to be seen.  He goes to the Tavern at 5 looking for Demi, only to find Cody has her restrained.  He takes "custody" of her, and 
      they begin packing.
      Madame can see that the Baroness was put in the jail at 5.
      Cody goes back to the house to find the Baroness (and the emeralds) missing.
      The strongarm 3000 dealer arrives at the Ranchhouse at 5.  Waits for an hour, talks to Cody, leaves town saying he will return in a week.
      Dakota lights the jailhouse on fire. at 6.  She says she was at the brothel, but nobody can place here there, and it is next to the jail.  
      She has opportunity and motive.

  - Madame: 
    - >
      Madame spends most of the day in the brothel, but helps with lunch at the Tavern.  From the brothel porch, she has a good view 
      of the back and front of the jail, the tavern, and the ranchhouse.
      She sees that Cowboy left the jail, and returns to the brothel.  She sees him again at lunch, where Baroness threatens to take the 
      tavern once the strongarm 3000 gets here.  


  - Demi: 
    - > 
      Has blowout with Baroness at the tavern.  Afterwards, has a drink with Cowboy, where he lets slip that the Baroness is getting the emeralds
      from the bank.
