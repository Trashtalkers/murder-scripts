            Hi.  I am Morrow.  I am a robot <br />
            I am incapable of killing anyone, but I hear EVERYTHING.  You are all suspects in this murder mystery. <br />
            The County Marshall has locked us all in the tavern until he can get the lynching mob formed.  Mobs don't just form themselves! <br />
            He also gave each of you a tonic, which has temporarily erased your memory.  Don't worry, it will come back to you.  <br />
            It is a tavern, after all, so while we wait, we should have a few drinks. <br />
            We will have five toast (rounds) before the marshall comes in and reveals the killer or killers.  Before each toast, it is likely that you will remember more information. <br />
            This will include information, revelations, clues, tasks, and secrets. <br />  
            Information will help you remember who you are.  You should speak freely about this. <br />
            Revelations should be mentioned as soon as you can work it into the conversation, after the round, err.. I mean toast starts. <br />
            Secrets include information about yourself that is, umm.. less pleasant.  If someone asks or mentions your secret, you should reveal all details of that secret. <br />
            Clues are pieces of visual pieces of information. They should help jog your memory.<br />
            Tasks are things you must complete before the next toast. <br />
            Each round may not include all or any of the above for you. <br />
            I will send you this information before each toast so that you can review it. <br />
            Let me know when you are finished with each piece by "marking it as read." Then I'll know when all pieces are read and I will start the toast. <br />
            After the last toast, each of you will make an accusation.  You may be the murderer!  Don't worry, the lynch mob will be gentle. Hehe. <br />
            I feel a system update coming on.  I will need to reboot! I too will lose my memory, but don't worry.  It shall come back to me over time ... <br />
            3..2..1...  Hi!  My name is Morrow.  I am a robot.  What are we doing here?  Can I get you a drink?

            The year is 2204.  After the Ravage, civilization has receded back into marshall law, reminiscent of US frontier days. <br/>
            Baron's family has owned land in the area since the US frontier days.  This is one of the few ranchers that survived the ravage
            with living livestock.  The ranch has been very prosperous, expanding as the livestock has reproduced.  It funds much of Dodgetown, 
            which has also prospered.  Dodgetown has it's own tavern, sheriff's station, and even a brothel.  Baron and his wife, Baroness, 
            are beloved patriarches of Dodgetown.

            My home town did not fair well after the Ravage.  Resource became scarce, so I started traveling West, 
            following stories of prosperity.  I happened upon Dodgetown three years ago and Baron took you in like the 
            son he never had. <br />
            I work hard at the ranch, and I have a "work hard - play hard" mentality.  <br />
            I want to be more than "just a ranchhand."  People see me as charming and ambitious. 
        secrets:
          - >
            Since Baron has died, the ranch is barely holding it together.  I have taken a bigger role, trying to fill the

            I am the only child of Baron and Baroness.   <br />
            I left town when I was 15 and left with the travelling circus.  That is the last time I have stepped 
            foot on the ranch or talked to my parents.  I have seen the world, at least, what is left after the Ravage.  During my travels,
            I became a skilled trapeze artist, gymnast, and actor. <br />
            I am in the best shape of my life and with the latest success in my acting troupe, well renowned 
            around the world.
          - >
            I have always wanted to make amends with my parents, well, at least my father..  
        secrets:

            I returned to town the day before my father died.
          - > 
            I was kicked out of the circus because of my attitude.  I mean, I am a star. BUT, the other
            characters revolted and I was left on the side of the road as the circus travelled on.
          - >
            I made favor with a traveling acting group.  Unfortunately, and this is hard to admit, I have no formal acting training.  
            I gave it the ol college try, but they ended up 
            giving me a non-speaking role.  My face portrayed on the announcement is a bit of a mockery, I'm afraid.
          - > 
            I don't have a gold coin to my name.  What little I made with the circus and other work, I used to
            get back home.

            My name is Casey, but since I was a kid, everyone has just called me Cowboy. 
            I rambled in just a few months ago.  I was really just passing through.  I've been following a lead about 
            a gold streak in a property West of Dodgetown. <br />
            I carry my guns proudly in the open, and I'm not afraid to use them. <br />
            Unfortunately, it comes at a price sometimes.  I have a fresh gunshot wound on my shoulder.  (Complain about it often!)

            Six weeks ago, I nearly killed Rusty, the sheriff, in a gunfight.  I was quicker, but he did get a shot in.  
            It was really just a flesh wound, but it took me a few days to recover, which I did at the brothel.  
          - >
            Gun fighting hasn't paid well, and I don't have much money.  I owe the madame for the nights during 
            the recovery and for other services.

            my tribe has owned this land since the dawn of time.  In the frontier days, it was split with
            the settlers peacefully.  Afterwards, it shrank over time, as the tribe was forced to smaller parsels due
            to "progress." <br />
            Since the Ravage, my people have reclaimed unused land, and the land has been ranched and farmed
            successfully.  The tribe is prosperous.  They trade with the surrounding villages, and they have 
            built up the reservation, in some ways better than Dodgetown.  We have a school, for example. <br /> 
            I am the heir to the tribe, I will be named Chief(tess).  I have been groomed and educated to lead my people. It was 
            my idea to build the school.  
        secrets:

            I believe the Baron is using his money and power to stranglehold the tribe.  Fewer people will trade

            Six months ago, Baron stole a large track of land from the tribe, and held it with armed guards.  He begin mining the land
            soon thereafter.

            I moved to Dodgetown 10 years ago.  It was just a speck on the map before I got there.  I talked my way into 
            Baron's good graces, and he loaned me the money to build the brothel.  Business is booming!  Ranchhands, traders, prospectors, and 
            business men flow through my rooms.<br />
            Last year, I opened the tavern, as overflow for the brothel.  I bought Morrow.  He can mostly run it by himself, but he 
            is limited.. only being a robot.<br />
            I don't serve indians, and I ain't afraid to say it.

            I am stretched thin.  The tavern has been more difficult to manage.  There have been multiple unwanted claims to the tavern 
            by strong-armed men.  The sheriff, Rusty, has looked away when this happened, and I had to ask for help from Baron.

            I have been here since.. well, since the start.  Born and raised in Dodgetown, I "took the star" when I was 18. <br />
            I have done my best to keep the peace, sometimes the hard way.  Baron's ranch keeps me busy, and I have to know when 
            to negotiate and when to lay down the law.  It is a hard balance. <br />
            I wouldn't openly take a bribe, but.. you know, I have to negotiate some times.

            I loved  Baroness.  Though no one can attest to my whereabouts at 5:45, 
            I was indeed at the Ranch house looking for my love.  We were going to live 
            and rule the town with the StrongArm 3000.  Life was going to be great.</p>
            <p>Baron, however, I was happy to see go.  I suspect that Cowboy had something to do

  Cowboy :
    - >
      Baron found a letter about the emeralds in the mine.  He hired Cowboy to take the mine and guard it.
      Rusty tried to enter the mine (on pretense of helping Dakota, but really to try to steal the emeralds),
      and he was shot by cowboy, four weeks ago.
      Cowboy wakes up from Jail, meets Baroness for lunch.  She asks him to be her body guard for the day, as she 
      has some expensive items to pick up from the bank.  Cowboy rebukes her.  He's heard about the StrongArm 3000
      and he knows it could be used against him.

      She is going to use the emeralds to buy the "strong arm 3000," which she plans to fulfill her dream of taking the tavern.   
  Madame:
    - >
      Before the Baroness arrived in town, Madame and Baron were a steady couple.  Upon her arrival, however, 
      she became something of an outcast.  She supported herself the only way she knew how, and the brothel
      was born.  More girls have come in, and she has grown with the town.
      She has heard rumors about Baron's purchase of the StrongArm 3000, and she is against it. 
      Rusty is a snake in the grass, but at least he can be bribed.  Anyone with too much power is a problem,
      and Baron would rule the entire town.
      Since Baron's death, Baroness has made multiple threats that she would run Madame out of town with 
      the Strong Arm 3000. 
      She pushes Rusty to do something about it.
  Dakota:
    - >
      Dakota and Rusty were lovers before Demi showed up.
      Dakota had known there were emeralds in the mine before Baron took it forcefully.  She pushed Rusty to do something about it.
      After the gunfight, she went back in with a crew, but the mine had been depleted.  She wanted revenge, but was worried 
      about rumors of the strong arm 3000.  If it were to come true, Baron would be able to take over the entire
      reservation if he wanted to.  
      Has lunch at the tavern.  Overhears that the strongarm 3000 will be delivered today.  Tells Madame.
      Dakota knows that Rusty has the emeralds.  Dakota is in the Tavern when Cole delivers Demi to Rusty, assumes
      she is in the jail.  She sees that Rusty is not in the jail, so she lights it on fire.
  Rusty: 
    - >
      Rusty knew about the mine ordeal since the Baron took it forcefully, but looked the other way after a little padding from Baron. 
      When Dakota finally pressed the issue, he went out the mine only to get in a fight with Cowboy.  In the end, the mine was 
      returned to Dakota's tribe, so.. you know.. peace upheld.  During the brawl, he learned about the mined emeralds.
      Rusty has been infatuated with Demi since her arrival.  He would leave town if she wanted to.  He let her know about the emeralds, 
      and she believes that the emeralds should belong to her, not her mother. 
      Rusty woke up in the brothel, in Demi's room.  She learns that the emeralds are out of the bank, and talks Rusty into attempting to 
      steal them at 4.
      Cole catches Demi in the act, restrains her, and takes her to the jail, but Rusty is not there.  He goes to the tavern, 
      then brothel, looking for Rusty.
      Rusty, is caught in the act by the Baroness, but he steals the emeralds.  He restrains the Baroness, then takes her to the jail the long way, 
      so as not to be seen.  He goes to the Tavern at 5 looking for Demi, only to find Cody has her restrained.  He takes "custody" of her, and 
      they begin packing.
      Madame can see that the Baroness was put in the jail at 5.
      Cody goes back to the house to find the Baroness (and the emeralds) missing.
      The strongarm 3000 dealer arrives at the Ranchhouse at 5.  Waits for an hour, talks to Cody, leaves town saying he will return in a week.
      Dakota lights the jailhouse on fire. at 6.  She says she was at the brothel, but nobody can place here there, and it is next to the jail.  
      She has opportunity and motive.



  Demi: 
    - > 
      Has blowout with Baroness at the tavern.  Afterwards, has a drink with Cowboy, where he lets slip that the Baroness is getting the emeralds
      from the bank.
