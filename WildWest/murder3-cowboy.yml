            Hi.  I am Morrow.  I am a robot <br />
            I am incapable of killing anyone, but I hear EVERYTHING.  I know who the killer(s) are among us. <br />
            You, however, ARE capable.  You are all suspects in this murder mystery. <br />
            The Governor has locked us all in the tavern until he can get the lynching mob formed.  Mobs don't just form themselves! <br />
            He also gave each of you a tonic, which has temporarily wiped your memory.  Don't worry, it will come back to you.  <br />
            It is a tavern, after all, so while we wait, we should have a few drinks. <br />
            We will have five drinks (rounds) before I reveal the killer or killers.  Before each toast, it is likely that you will remember more information. <br />
            This will include information, revelations, clues, tasks, and secrets. <br />  
            Information will help you remember who you are.  You should speak freely about this. <br />
            Revelations should be mentioned as soon as you can work it into the conversation, after the round starts. <br />
            Secrets include information about yourself that is, umm.. less pleasant.  If someone asks or mentions your secret, you should reveal all details of that secret. <br />
            Clues are pieces of visual pieces of information. They should help jog your memory.<br />
            Tasks are things you must complete during the round. <br />
            Each round may not include all or any of the above for you. <br />
            I will send you this information before each toast so that you can review it. <br />
            Let me know when you are finished with each piece by "marking it as read." Then I'll know when all pieces are read and I will start the toast. <br />
            After the last toast, each of you will make an accusation.  You may be the murderer!  Don't worry, the lynch mob will be gentle. Hehe. <br />
            I feel a system update coming on.  I will need to reboot! I too will lose my memory, but don't worry.  It shall come back to me over time ... <br />
            3..2..1...  Hi!  My name is Morrow.  I am a robot.  What are we doing here?  Can I get you a drink?
    clue:
      An advertisement for a "StrongArm 3000, the robot guardian"  Guaranteed to keep the peace.. or cause trouble, for the right price.

            Baron's family has owned land in the area since the US frontier days.  This is one of the few ranchers that survived the ravage
            with living livestock.  The ranch has been very prosperous, expanding as the livestock has reproduced.  It funds much of Dodgetown, 
            which has also prospered.  Dodgetown has it's own tavern, sheriff's station, and even a brothel.  Baron and his wife, Baroness, 
            are beloved patriarches of Dodgetown.

        information:        
          - >
            Your home town did not fair well after the Ravage.  Resource became scarce, so you started traveling West, 
            following stories of prosperity.  You happened upon Dodgetown three years ago and Baron took you in like the 
            son he never had.
          - >
            You work hard at the ranch, and you have a "work hard - play hard" mentality.  You like to party.  You are old enough to know better, but...    
          - >
            You frequent the tavern... and the brothel.  
          - >
            You want to be more than "just a ranchhand."  You are charming and ambitious. 
        secrets:
          - >
            You and Dakota are friends.  Dakota's ranch has a school house, which you visit often.  You never got a formal education.     
          - >
            Since Baron has died, the ranch is barely holding it together.  You have taken a bigger role, trying to fill the 
            shoes of Baron.  You have even taken his bed.
      Madame:
        tasks:
          - Introduce yourself.
        information:        
          - >
            You moved to Dodgetown 10 years ago.  It was just a spec on the map before you got there.  You talked your way into 
            Baron's good graces, and he loaned you the money to build the brothel.  Business is booming!  Ranchhands, traders, prospectors, and 
            business men flow through your rooms.
          - > 
            Last year, you opened the tavern, as overflow for the brothel.  You bought Morrow.  He can mostly run it by himself, but he 
            is limited.. only being a robot.
          - >
            You don't serve indians, are you aren't afraid to say it.
        secrets:
          - >
            Baroness is your mortal enemy.  Her insults about your business has nearly brought you to blows.     
          - >
            You are stretched thin.  The tavern has been more difficult to manage.  There have been multiple unwanted claims to the tavern 
            by strong-armed men.  The sheriff, Rusty, has looked away when this happened, and you had to ask for help from Baron.
      
      Rusty:

          - Introduce yourself.
        information:        
          - >
            You have been here since.. well, since the start.  Born and raised in Dodgetown, you "took the star" when you were 18. 
          - > 
            You have done your best to keep the peace, sometimes the hard way.  Baron's ranch keeps you busy, and you have to know when 
            to negotiate and when to lay down the law.  It is a hard balance.
          - >
            You wouldn't openly take a bribe, but.. you know, you have to negotiate some times.
        secrets:
          - >
            You nearly killed Cowboy in a gunfight.  He was quicker, but your aim was better.  He got you in the leg, which has
            slowed you down a bit.  Given the chance, you'd gladly put another bullet in Cowboy.
          - > 
            Though you are younger, you had fling with Baroness when you were younger.  She catch her looking at you longingly, even after her marriage.

            You rambled in just a few months ago.  You were really just passing through.  You are tracking down
            a story about a gold streak in a property West of Dodgetown.
          - >
            You carry your guns proudly in the open, and you aren't afraid to use them.

            You nearly killed Rusty, the sheriff, in a gunfight.  You were quicker, but he did get a shot in.  
            It was really just a flesh wound, but it took you a few days to recover, which you did atscenar the brothel.  
          - >
            Gun fighting hasn't paid well, and you don't have much money.  You owe the madame for the nights during 
            the recovery and for other services.

            You left town when you were 15 and left with the travelling circus.  That is the last time you have stepped 
            foot on the ranch.  You have seen the world, at least, what is left after the Ravage.  During your travels,
            you became a skilled trapeze artist, gymnist, and actor.

            You have always wanted to make amends with your parents.  
        secrets:
          - > 
            You were kicked out of the circus because of your attitude.  You believe you are the star, but the other
            characters revolted and you were left on the side of the road as the circus travelled on.
          - >
            You made favor with a traveling acting group.  Unfortunately, you can't act.  You try, but they ended up 
            giving you a non-speaking role.  Your face portrayed on the announce in a bit of a mockery.
          - > 
            You don't have a gold coin to your name.  What little you made with the circus and other work, you used to
            get back home.

            Your tribe has owned this land since the dawn of time.  In the frontier days, it was split with
            the settlers peacefully.  Afterwards, it shrank over time, as the tribe was forced to smaller parsels due
            to "progress."
          - >
            Since the Ravage, your people have reclaimed unused land, and the land has been ranched and farmed
            successfully.  The tribe is prosperous.  They trade with the surrounding villages, and they have 
            built up the reservation, in some ways better than Dodgetown.  You have a school, for example.
          - > 
            You are the heir to be Chief(tess).  You have been groomed and educated to lead your people. It was

            You believe the Baron is using his money and power to stranglehold the tribe.  Fewer people will trade
