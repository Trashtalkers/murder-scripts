              # Welcome to **Way out West!**  

              It is the spring of 1884. America's west coast is slowly being
              populated with small towns full of settlers who come to prospect
              for precious metals, set up ranches and run dubious saloons—and
              now the *railroad is coming!*  

              ___

              Cactus Gulch is one such small town. Founded twenty years ago,
              tonight it has a festive air as the townsfolk get set to start their 20th
              anniversary celebrations. However, all is not running smoothly. 

              ___

              Land disputes, disreputable card games, strange folk from out of
              town, and quarrels with the Indians all add to a tense atmosphere.
              Join us in the Silver Dollar Saloon as celebrations begin, and find
              out how the evening unfolds…

              Folks, I'm sorry to stop the celebrations. I have some real bad news to tell you.
              The stable hand has found Zeke Calhoun lying in the stable, and I'm afraid to say…
              He's dead!
              Looks like he'd been in some sort of fight and got a nasty blow to the head. Also looks
              as if his hands were tied, but the rope has already been cut.
              One other strange thing, the top pocket of his shirt had been cut open—there ain't
              nothing inside.
              I can't tell you what the cause of death was yet; there are no signs of shooting or
              strangling or that the blow on the head was enough to kill him.
              Folks, no one is to leave town until this mystery has been solved.
          - title: "The scene of the crime"
            markdown: >
              The body of Zeke Calhoun is slumped in the corner of the stables, out of sight of the
              door. He is battered about the face and body, with a nasty bruise to the left temple.
              His wrists are chafed, reddened, and in an awkward position behind his back as
              though they have been tied together. On the ground nearby are short lengths of rope,
              cut with a sharp knife. A toppled chair is nearby.
              The top pocket of Zeke's plaid shirt has been cut open and is flapping empty. Apart
              from that, his pockets contain the usual sorts of things and do not seem to have been
              searched.
              There are no signs of shooting, stabbing or strangling. It does not look like the blow on
              the head was enough to kill him.

            markdown: >
              Zeke Calhoun is dead, sure enough, and it was greed that did for him. His own greed,
              gambling in a crooked game with Doc Faraday, and the greed of the people who
              wanted his land.
              Zeke lost Fat Bull Range to Doc, but a witness saw Doc cheat: Blaise Sadler. So the
              people who wanted Fat Bull Range for their railroad needed another tactic in case the
              judgment went in Zeke's favor. They had a hold over Judge Paulson, with evidence of
              his frauds back East: but if he was discredited, the Sheriff or Deputy would make the
              judgment, and they were less easy to manipulate. So the villains confronted Zeke and
              tried to force him to agree to sell to them.
              Zeke was an elderly and unfit man, and the strain of being threatened and beaten was
              too much for his poor heart. The killers didn't mean to murder him, I don't reckon—
              but they're guilty of his death, for sure.
              Who was it, then, who had all these pieces—an agreement with Doc, a hold over the
              judge, and a history of ruthless greed? Step forward Clem Parham of Mid West Rail
              and Clem's hired killer Slick O'Hare, or Saul Jackson as he's really named. It's the
              gallows for you both—hang 'em high!
